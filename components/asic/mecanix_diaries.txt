Ticket Mask 0xC0000000 & Version Mask 0x007FE000 really unleashes hashrates. <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

This new asic_set_ticket_mask() function replaces this call:

---------------------------------
FILES asic_tweaks.c/.h

Usage:
set_ticket_mask(256); //Param mapped to difficulty (easier to understand, stratum diff ready too) //256 = ESP Miner
set_version_mask(0x1FFFE000, true);

I've added the calls in my UI so I can just hack up that BM1370 ASSic runtime. Same I do with Freq & mVolts.
Hopefully friend @unpainted can do something similar for you guys on ESP Miner.
Same code style; high-performance lookup tables, bypasses bit swapping and all that other cycle-wasting madness that ESP Miner is so good at lol
Works flawlessly. Hack the puppy on the fly. >hashrates great now, can tweak for the conditions (high diff pools, Solo, Pooled, etc).
BUT (but but)
I still haven't confirmed whether that 6.01G I got was indeed luck, or the fact that I was using a lower Version Mask.
Only Time can tell. Wish me luck!

Works equally well on the BM1368. Just tried my quad hashboard with the same code.
No idea about 1366s I can't try right now but I presume it works as good.
Safe. Have at it.
Next: ASICBoost implementation. I'll look into this.

Confirmed BM1366 (Hex board). That's yet another situation when this 'asic tweak' comes in handy (multichips). Want that on a faster job switch than pool's default. Industry hacks... lots to learn


The likes of Chat Gpt & Co Ltd knows all about nonce space and asic tech. They obv don't have the datasheet, tables and registers, however they grasp the concept of the hardware Version rolling and Ticketing better than I'll ever do in a lifetime. Ask'm!!

Be mindful that what works ootb for a single asic bitaxe doesn't for a multichip unit. Same is true for Solo -vs- Pooled Mining. Day and Night different set-up requirements. In that context; being able to tweak at the hardware level is not a feature, but more or less vital rather ðŸ˜‰
What I'm trying to say is "Do It". Good luck and May You Find Inspiration!!

All right.
What are the best values for a single BM1370 in a solo mining job? Or how would you approach this task?

I've just put up the facilitation to learn all that myself. That was Step One in my quest to have the ability to tweak the puppies runtime. The next step will be to gather intel on their behaviors and hopefully answer your question ðŸ˜‰

Solo mining on a single chip unit --> lowest possible ticket mask (don't block anything) and highest nonce space.
Solo Multichips --> Remain low ticket however chop your nonce space in half (overhaul that's the idea behind).
Different set-up for different scenarios. If I understood how this cut-throat asic business works, and why each pools has their own secret lil closed source firmware. That's what they do with them... hacks the BM puppies.

@unpainted/Everyone - Please share setup that gives out better score results for the BM1370 <--crime culprit #1. Urgent.
Remember, its architecture pipeline's optimized for efficiency. Not raw speed :/
